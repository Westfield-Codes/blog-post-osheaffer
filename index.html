		<strong>Oftentimes I find myself relaxing in my chair, playing video games</strong>. They are by far my favourite form of media, brimming with unparalleled interactiveness and creative potential.
		<br>
		<br>
		And there is one such franchise in which I can always find comfort in returning to—
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox"><em>Star Fox</em></a>.
		<br><br>
		And I would love to share it with others.
		<br><br>
		Whether you like arcade action, detailed and interactable storylines and characters, or

		, the Star Fox series has something for most anyone.

	<h2 class="heading">What is <em>Star Fox</em>?</h2>
	<p>
		Star Fox is a series of <strong>space flight, rail gunner, and action-adventure</strong> video games with arcade elements such as a high score. They follow the Star Fox team of anthropomorphic animals who are led by series’ protagonist, Fox McCloud, and their missions within the Lylat system. The team fly in their iconic Arwing spaceships.

	<p class="caption">Objectively the best spaceship design out there.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		The first game, simply known as <em>Star Fox</em> (or <em>Starwing</em> in Europe and Australia), was developed by Nintendo and released in 1993 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It utilised a new technology of the time—the <strong>Super FX</strong> chip, developed by Argonaut Games, and allowed for advanced 2D and primitive 3D graphics, which was used by the makers of Star Fox to create a 3D environment in which players can fly around.

	<p class="caption">It may look primitive today, but these were once revolutionary graphics.</p>
	<br>
	<h2 class="heading">What makes <em>Star Fox</em> special?</h2>
	<p>Here are just a few things that give the <em>Star Fox</em> series its own identity—</p>
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>A charming cast of characters, each with there own backstories</li>
		<li>Intricate environments and worldbuilding</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Different factions</li>
				<li>Unique planets</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Arcade elements</li>
			<ul>
				<li>High Scores</li>
				<li>Replayability</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>
		The world of the <em>Star Fox</em> series is filled with detail and story. Being a video game as it is allows for a player to be a part within that story.
	</p>
	<p>
		The arcade aspects present throughout the games allow for high amounts of replayability as one tries to get a new high score by playing more efficiently than before, using knowledge and tricks that have been acquired over many playthroughs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>If you are interested and were to ask me which game to start with</strong>, I would likely have to go with <em>Star Fox 64</em> (<em>Lylat Wars</em> in Europe/Australia). It’s generally the most renowned game of the series, and a good starting point for anyone new to the games.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although <em>my</em> personal favourite of the bunch is <em>Star Fox: Assault</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That’s really about all I have to say... <em>for now</em>, at least.
